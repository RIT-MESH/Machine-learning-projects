# IPL data Analysis


## Problem Definition
As there is huge money involved in IPL, it’s very important to know the performance of players and
teams. This will give us an idea why companies are investing so much in them. Therefore the
objectives of this project are as follow:\
 **Analysis on the basis of year (eg: 2008)\
 Number of matches played\
 Team wise field and bat decision\
 Players with most Player of the match titles and their teams\
 Matches won by team\
 Win by highest run\
 Number of times team won match in a venue\
 To find the performance of individual player\
 To find most common ways of dismissal in IPL\
 To find the performance of bowlers\
 Bowlers with most balls in super overs\
 Bowlers with best economy\
 Bowlers with worst economy\
 Best performing Bowler\
 Bowlers given most wide balls\
 Highest wicket by bowler in each season\
 To find the performance of batsman\
 Batsman with highest balls played\
 Batsman with highest runs\
 Highest Runs by Batsman in each season\
 Top 10 Batsman\
 Top Individual Scores\
 Batsmen with best strike rate\
 Batsman who scored most runs in super overs\
 To find the performance of fielders\
 Best performing fielders\
 To find score distribution For Teams by Innings\
 To find Players with most Player of the match titles and their teams\
 Best Stumpers and their teams\
 Total Season wise toss decision\
 Total number of times Team won matches after batting first\
 Total number of times Team won matches after batting second\
 Team performance while batting first inning\
 Team performance while batting second inning\
 Team won maximum matches per season\
 Number of times team won match in a venue\
 Teams with most wins and the cities\
 Cities hosted maximum IPL matches**

### Classification
Now, we use the training and split method to build classifier models to predict the winner
and prepare a final report for the F1-scores of the models. We will also do Hyper-tuning
using GridSearchCV to tune the parameters of models.\
We will use the following algorithm:\
 **K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)\
 Decision Tree\
 Support Vector Machine\
 Logistic Regression\
 Random forest\
 Perceptron**
