# README: Text Preprocessing Notebook

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook is designed for **text preprocessing** in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. It includes various functions to clean and prepare text data for further analysis, machine learning, or deep learning tasks. The preprocessing steps help improve model performance by removing unwanted elements from text data.

## Features
The notebook includes the following text preprocessing functions:
1. **Removing HTML Tags** - `remove_html_tag(text)`
2. **Removing URLs** - `remove_url(text)`
3. **Removing Special Characters & Punctuation**
4. **Converting Text to Lowercase**
5. **Removing Stopwords**
6. **Tokenization**
7. **Stemming & Lemmatization**
8. **Vectorization (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, etc.)**

## Step-by-Step Procedure
### 1. Install Dependencies (if required)
Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. If not, install them using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy nltk scikit-learn
```

### 2. Load Dataset
If working with a dataset, ensure it is properly loaded using Pandas:
```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("dataset.csv")
```

### 3. Import Required Libraries
```python
import re
import nltk
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
```

### 4. Define Text Preprocessing Functions
Each function removes unnecessary elements from text, improving data quality for analysis. 

#### a) Remove HTML Tags
```python
def remove_html_tag(text):
    pattern = re.compile('<.*?>')
    return pattern.sub("", text)
```

#### b) Remove URLs
```python
def remove_url(text):
    pattern = re.compile(r'https?://\S+|www\.\S+')
    return pattern.sub("", text)
```

### 5. Apply Functions to Text Data
Example usage of functions on a dataset:
```python
data['cleaned_text'] = data['text'].apply(remove_html_tag).apply(remove_url)
```

### 6. Further Processing (Optional)
Additional steps like **stopword removal, tokenization, and vectorization** can be applied.

#### Example: Convert Text to Lowercase
```python
data['cleaned_text'] = data['cleaned_text'].str.lower()
```

#### Example: Tokenization
Tokenization is the process of splitting text into smaller components, such as words or sentences. This step is essential in NLP as it helps in analyzing and processing text efficiently.

```python
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
nltk.download('punkt')
data['tokens'] = data['cleaned_text'].apply(word_tokenize)
```
Here, `word_tokenize()` splits sentences into individual words, making it easier for further text analysis like removing stopwords, stemming, and lemmatization.

### 7. Train ML Model (If Needed)
Once the text is preprocessed, it can be used to train machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression:
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data['cleaned_text'], data['label'], test_size=0.2)
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, predictions))
```

## Summary
This notebook provides essential text preprocessing steps for NLP. By following these steps, raw text data can be cleaned and prepared for use in **machine learning** and **deep learning models**.

### Next Steps
- Expand text preprocessing with **named entity recognition (NER)**.
- Implement **deep learning models (LSTMs, Transformers, etc.)**.
- Use external datasets for real-world applications.
